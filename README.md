## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5** - Accessible and meaningful markup
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with custom properties, flexbox, and media queries
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, pure ES6+ JavaScrip
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Reusable color variables for consistent theming
- **Flexbox** - Flexible layout system for responsive design
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Designed for mobile, enhanced for desktop
- **Responsive Images** - `<picture>` element for optimal image delivery across devices
- **Google Fonts** - Roboto font family for typography

### Key features implemented

#### 1. Email Validation
```javascript
function isValidEmail(email) {
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```
- Dual validation: HTML5 pattern attribute + JavaScript regex
- Real-time error display on invalid submission
- Input clearing on validation error

#### 2. Dynamic Success Message
- Success overlay appears with user's email address
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Dismiss button to reset the form

#### 3. Interactive States
- **Email Input**: Orange/yellow border on hover and focus
- **Subscribe Button**: Gradient background transition (red → orange) with shadow effect
- Smooth CSS transitions for enhanced user experience

#### 4. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Breakpoint: 88rem (1408px) for desktop layout
- Responsive images using `<picture>` element with multiple sources
- Flexible container sizing with `clamp()` function

#### 5. CSS Architecture
- CSS Custom Properties for maintainable color system
- Modular CSS with semantic class names
- Transition effects for smooth interactions

### What I learned

- **Form Validation**: Implemented both HTML5 and JavaScript validation for robust email checking
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Utilized CSS variables for a maintainable color system and easy theming
- **Responsive Images**: Learned to use the `<picture>` element with multiple sources for optimal image delivery across devices
- **Flexbox Mastery**: Improved understanding of flexbox for creating flexible, responsive layouts
- **State Management**: Managed multiple UI states (default, hover, focus, error, success) with CSS classes and JavaScript
- **Accessibility**: Ensured proper semantic HTML, form labels, and interactive element focus states
- **Modern CSS**: Utilized modern CSS features like `clamp()`, transitions, and gradients for enhanced UX

### Continued development

Areas I'd like to continue focusing on:

- **Animation Library**: Explore CSS animations and transitions for more dynamic interactions
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for images and optimize bundle size
- **Testing**: Add unit tests for form validation logic
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Further improve form validation with backend integration
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode variant using CSS custom properties
